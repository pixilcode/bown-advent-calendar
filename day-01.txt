December 1st

Each member of your family can give the Savior a special gift by trying to live the law of love in some special way during this Christmas month.

Write what you are going to do to show love to Jesus on a piece of paper and put it in a box. Then, wrap the box up and put it under the tree. On Christmas Day, open the present and see if you gave the Savior a gift.
