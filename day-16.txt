What did Christ do when someone offended Him?

Read Matthew 27:29-31

Your very own bishop is a forgiving man. He understands that we are all going to do things that are wrong and that we will regret later.

How could you as a family show your love to your bishop? Maybe you could all write a letter or make a special treat and secretly deliver it to him tonight.
