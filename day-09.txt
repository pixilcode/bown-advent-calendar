December 9th

There is no account that tells us just how many wise men came to worship the Savior. There may have been three or maybe ten. But how many came is not as important as that there were wise men who came to present their gifts and worship this wondrous child. We today should remember that men who are wise still seek him. If they prayerfully seek, they will find Him.

Now go and seek under your pillow and ye shall find.
