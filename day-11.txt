December 11th

Have you ever wondered if Jesus really was the Savior? We all need to have the seed of faith planted in our hearts. As we take care of it and it begins to form, our faith fills our lives with blessings and we find miracles happening in our lives. These may not be miracles like the moving of mountains, but we will notice changes taking place in ourselves and those around us that we thought would never happen. We will feel the blessings of our Heavenly Father in our lives and have reason to rejoice. We will have the confidence and strength to hold on to the iron rod until we reach eternal life.

Can you find a plant in your house that grew from a seed? That seed was planted just like your own seed of faith that must be planted in your heart and then fed and nourished.
