December 15th

Was Christ kind? Give an example of his kindness.

Now ask your dad to leave the room. Is he gone?

Your very own dad is a kind man who is trying to be as kind as the Savior. What could you as a family do to show kindness to your dad? Keep this a secret until tomorrow night, then surprise him with it.
