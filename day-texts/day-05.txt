December 5th

The sign for Christ's birth was fulfilled. What was that sign for the Nephites?

Read Helaman 14:3-6

Did you know that the reason you see so many candles at Christmas time is because it is a symbol to remind you of the bright star at the birth of Jesus?

Light a candle and sing Silent Night.
