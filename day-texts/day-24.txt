December 24th

Tonight is a special night.

Sing Christmas carols to a few neighbors or as a family around a lit candle. Take time to sing everyone's favorite Christmas carol. If the time is appropriate, have dad lead the family in a testimony sharing time. Discuss how you have felt closer to Christ this month.
