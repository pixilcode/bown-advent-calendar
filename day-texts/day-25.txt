December 25th

Remember to unwrap your present under the tree containing your special gift you wanted to give Christ this Christmas season. Read and evaluate how you did and what changes you made that you like and would want to cary on to the New Year.

Try and record your thoughts and/or testimony in a journal to reflect on through the years. Remember how much love Jesus has for all of His children.

Most of all, have a very Merry Christmas!
