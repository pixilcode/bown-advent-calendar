What did Jesus teach us about prayer?

Read Matthew 6:5-13

Your mom has taught you about prayer since the day you were born. Ask your mom to leave the room for a moment. Is she gone?

Can you think of a wonderful service you can do for your mom over the next could of days? Try to make it a surprise.
