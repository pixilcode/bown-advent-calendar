still seek him. If they prayerfully seek, they will find Him.</p>

the seed of faith planted in our hearts. As we take care of it and it begins
to form, our faith fills our lives with blessings and we find miracles
happening in our lives. These may not be miracles like the moving of
mountains, but we will notice changes taking place in ourselves and those
around us that we thought would never happen. We will feel the blessings of
our Heavenly Father in our lives and have reason to rejoice. We will have
the confidence and strength to hold on to the iron rod until we reach
eternal life.</p>
